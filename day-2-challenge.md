# Day 2 - Challenge

For both tasks, you should create your tests files under the `src/__tests__/` directory.

## Task 1

Create tests for the `NinjaNameGeneratorTab` component.

You don't need to re-test the behavior tested in the day 1 challenge. Just the new data fetching feature.

## Task 2

Create tests for all the features in the `NinjaNameExamplesTab` component.

At a high level, the features are: the fetching, the **re**fetching and the **auto**-refetching of the name list from the API.

## How to run the tests

Run `npm run test`.
